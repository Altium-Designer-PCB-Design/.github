## What is Altium Designer?

**Altium Designer** is the world's leading professional-grade software for designing printed circuit boards (PCBs). Used by electronics engineers and hardware designers globally, Altium Designer provides a unified environment for schematic capture, PCB layout, and manufacturing output generation. Unlike basic PCB tools, Altium Designer offers advanced features like high-speed design rules, 3D PCB visualization, and seamless component management that enable the creation of complex, multi-layer boards for consumer electronics, aerospace, automotive, and industrial applications.

The software represents the industry standard for professional PCB design, combining powerful routing capabilities with intelligent design rule checking to ensure manufacturability and reliability. With its integrated approach to electronic design automation (EDA), Altium Designer streamlines the entire development process from concept to production, reducing errors and improving collaboration between engineering teams. Its native 3D engine allows designers to visualize PCBs in realistic environments, checking for mechanical conflicts and optimizing component placement.
